That is certainly the case for Ruth (Molly Windsor), a shy and slightly awkward girl. “Make Up” begins when she turns up at a Cornish caravan site in the middle of the night to join her boyfriend, Tom (Joseph Quinn). He’s worked there for the past few summers; she’s never been allowed to visit before. It is the end of the season, and the place is half deserted, damp and covered in plastic sheeting so the caravans can be fumigated.</p><p >It is obvious she doesn’t belong there. Ruth has never swum in the sea, for one thing, and Tom is part of the furniture while she is resolutely an “incomer” or “emmet”: a local nickname for the non-Cornish (she is from Derby). And there’s something going on with Tom, too. She finds a smear of lipgloss on his mirror and some long copper-coloured hair on his clothes. He, and everyone else, denies that there’s a redhead in the vicinity. Ruth knows better.</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-1" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p >Written and directed by Claire Oakley—this is her debut feature—the plot of “Make Up” is sparse. Yet the film is an unexpected treat, by turns terrifying and tender. Ruth’s relationship with Tom chills along with the weather and she is haunted by glimpses of a woman with long red hair⁠—in the water, between deserted cabins, outside in the dark⁠—whom no one else seems to see.</p><p >This leaves plenty of room for viewers to witness the slow, sad deterioration of Ruth’s first and only relationship. She is there to be with him, but Tom seems intent on being anywhere else. Neither of them seem able to pick up the threads of their relationship and weave them back together again. Without him she seems unmoored, increasingly prey to dread, paranoia and even the outright hostility of Kai (Theo Barklem-Biggs), a local boy and Tom’s friend and boss.</p><p >Soon the film’s only source of warmth is Ruth’s friendship with Jade (Stefanie Martini), an alluring Cornish girl who also lives and works at the caravan site. She is smiling and vivacious, paints Ruth’s nails scarlet, gets her drunk, makes her laugh and asks her questions about herself. “I came here to get away,” Ruth tells her. “No you didn’t,” Jade says without rancour. “You came here to be with Tom.” Her company is free of stifling judgment, and Ruth unfurls like a flower.</p><p >Visually, “Make Up” is gorgeous. Nick Cooke, the director of photography, makes the most of the contrast between the misty Cornish seaside, the cramped, glowing interiors of the caravans and the dark outside. In one memorable shot, vermillion propane tanks sit outside the serried ranks of white caravans, like buoys bobbing on ships at anchor. The film packs an aural punch too. Throughout viewers are assailed by the rustle of plastic sheeting, the howling wind, the creak of something moving about under disused floorboards and, at night, shrieks out in the dark. “It’s foxes,” Tom assures the unnerved Ruth. “Cubs leaving their mothers and growing up.”</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-2" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p >Ultimately, the ratcheting tension breaks, as it must. But when it does, the audience is not confronted with the grisly remains or dark secrets that it has been led to expect. “Make Up” is both a coming-of-age tale and a love story—one in which the heroine is left settled more comfortably inside herself.</p><p ><em>“Make Up” is being screened in cinemas in Britain now</em></p>
