But history has chosen her for a starring role. Despite her lack of political experience, she has come to personify the struggle to transform Belarus from docile former Soviet republic to free and truly independent nation. The leaders of rich democracies greet her as president-elect. Her own people derive comfort from her simple, calm words. Alexander Lukashenko, the gun-toting dictator who has ruled Belarus for the past 26 years, fears her enough to have forced her out of the country after she (probably) won a presidential election in August.</p><p >That was not meant to happen. All the main challengers, including Ms Tikhanovskaya’s husband, were in jail. Opinion polls were banned. The media and the security apparatus were firmly under the strongman’s control. Mr Lukashenko let a tongue-tied housewife with no taste for power register her candidacy, some say, just to demonstrate the futility of opposition.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But on August 9th, fed up with being treated like cattle, the people of Belarus voted for Ms Tikhanovskaya, whose only pledge was to release political prisoners and hold free and fair elections within six months. When Mr Lukashenko declared himself the winner, with 80% of the votes, they thronged into the streets. The dictator sent his goons to beat them up, just as he had done in 2006 and in 2010.</p><p >But this time the violence was so extreme that instead of clearing the streets of protesters, it detonated a national uprising. Petrified, Mr Lukashenko had Ms Tikhanovskaya taken hostage and coerced into reading a statement denouncing the protests before being driven out of the country. But this tactic, too, has failed.</p><p ><iframe height="215" src="//embed.acast.com/theintelligencepodcast/yourplanet-ormines-kickingthecoalhabit?seek=560"></iframe></p><p >Listen on: <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1449631195?mt=2&amp;ls=1">Apple Podcasts</a> | <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://open.spotify.com/show/12zKAMNyS2GNentUzxq9QN">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYWNhc3QuY29tL3RoZWludGVsbGlnZW5jZXBvZGNhc3Q">Google</a> | <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=357733&amp;refid=stpr">Stitcher</a> | <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://tunein.com/podcasts/News--Politics-Podcasts/The-Intelligence-p1186979/">TuneIn</a></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >“When I got here, I was in despair, ready to give up,” she tells <em>The Economist</em> in an interview in Vilnius, the capital of neighbouring Lithuania. “I felt like a traitor and when I saw people emerge from detention half-alive, I felt guilt.” But instead of blame, she got support and compassion from the Belarusians. “When people came out again the next day, after all that happened, I knew I could not stop,” she says, struggling to hold back tears. And so, after three days of despair, she recorded a new appeal to the nation and called for the protests to go on.</p><p >Growing up in Mr Lukashenko’s tightly controlled Belarus, Ms Tikhanovskaya had little interest in politics or in the country’s history, its symbols or even its language. “I spoke Belarusian in the summer when I went to see my grandparents in the country,” she says: Russian the rest of the time. She never bothered with elections, and was unaware of a national revivalist movement that simmered under the surface among the country’s artistic and intellectual elite. She could not have imagined that members of that circle, including Franak Viacorka, a journalist and one of the chief ideologists of the movement, would become her right-hand advisers.</p><p >Unlike them, she was not exercised by the red-and-white flag of the short-lived 1918 Belarusian republic, briefly readopted as the national banner of post-Soviet Belarus only to be crumpled by Mr Lukashenko three years later. She lived instead under a modified green-and-red flag taken from Soviet-era Belarus that Mr Lukashenko brought in. The Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war is the main national holiday. “To me Belarus was a geographic territory inside the former Soviet Union,” she says.</p><p >For years Mr Lukashenko, almost unique among post-Soviet leaders, cultivated a Soviet rather than a national Belarusian identity, in the hope that he might claim the throne of a reconstituted Russian-Belarusian empire. That hope was crushed by the emergence of Vladimir Putin as Russia’s all-powerful leader after 1999. And Mr Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 made Mr Lukashenko nervous; he came instead to reimagine himself as the guardian of the country’s sovereignty against Russia.</p><p >But by doing so, he stepped into an unfamiliar space, already occupied by nationalists armed with social media, modern technology, history and ideas. Between them they have built uncontrollable Telegram social media channels that link 3m people, half the adult population of Belarus. Mr Lukashenko provided plenty of fuel for their movement. His ridiculous denials of the coronavirus pandemic mobilised civil society; his blatant election-rigging turned a routine election into a struggle for national emancipation. Ms Tikhanovskaya, an ordinary Belarusian woman, became the face of a mass movement.</p><p >The protesters lacked a radical edge. A perfect opportunity arose in late August, when thousands of people besieged a detention centre where people were being tortured, raped and beaten so that their screaming could be heard outside. But at the critical moment, out of nowhere, came a few hundred mysterious “volunteers” who formed a human chain and pleaded with their “fellow” protesters not to storm the jail. So the storming of the Belarusian Bastille never happened.</p><p >Since then, Mr Lukashenko has managed to regain some control and squeeze the protesters from the city centre. They have retreated into courtyards and residential areas, where protests are harder to monitor and control. Mr Lukashenko hopes to wear the protesters out. But a recent poll conducted by Warsaw-based sociologists shows that 84% of those protesting are prepared to go on until Mr Lukashenko is gone. The Kremlin, which has so far backed Mr Lukashenko politically and economically, is aware of this and is nudging him to start preparing for a transition, under a new constitution.</p><p >Mr Lukashenko may cling to power a little longer. But the red-and-white flag will not be put away. “I am proud to be Belarusian. We are an independent country in the middle of Europe. Our readiness to stand for each other is what makes us a nation,” says Ms Tikhanovskaya. Her story is surely not over. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline &quot;A new country struggles to be born&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
