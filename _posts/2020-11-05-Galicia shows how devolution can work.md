Today Galicia stands out for two other reasons. The first is that since democracy arrived four decades ago, it has progressed from being one of the poorest regions of Spain to enjoying an income only slightly below the national average. Its second peculiarity is that like Catalonia or the Basque Country it is a cultural nation but, unlike them, it is one that is comfortable in Spain. Separatism is the pursuit of a fairly small minority.</p><p >Its economic success is broad-based. Apart from Europe’s largest fishing industry, shipbuilding, dairying and timber, Galicia has two industrial mainstays: Inditex, based near A Coruña, has grown into the world’s biggest provider of fast fashion through Zara and its other chains. A vast Citroën plant near Vigo anchors 30,000 car-industry jobs. The regional government has invested European funds in motorways: it is still six hours to Madrid, but it used to take twice as long. A high-speed railway link should be completed by 2022.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >There are other factors behind Galicia’s success. A tradition of dividing farms among all children led to rural poverty (and emigration) but also to a culture that values private property, the <em>leira</em> (homestead) and hard work. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the president of the regional government since 2009, highlights Galicia’s political stability. Mr Feijóo is from the conservative People’s Party, which at national level has become increasingly centralist. In Galicia it has adopted a strong regional identity that Mr Feijóo calls Galleguismo. “We have defended Galicia as a place that has its own language, culture, heritage and special characteristics,” he says. This has “halted nationalism”. At an election in July, Mr Feijóo retained his absolute majority of seats in the Galician parliament, another rarity for Spain.</p><p >Critics complain that he has failed to halt an exodus of talent, as young professionals seek opportunities abroad. In fact, Galicia has seen more immigrants than emigrants in this century. But it is an ageing society. The dynamism of the coast contrasts with a depopulated interior, prone to forest fires. The covid-19 pandemic, although mild in the region, may expose flaws in the Galician formula (with cases rising, on October 30th Mr Feijóo restricted movement into and out of the main towns). “The economic model gave priority to cement over knowledge,” says Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas, a historian at the University of Santiago de Compostela.</p><p >Galicia suffers the vices as well as the virtues of Spanish devolution. It has three airports, where one would do; Gallegos cross the border to Porto in Portugal for many international flights. Politics features localism. Abel Caballero, the mayor of Vigo since 2007, has made a successful political career out of battling Mr Feijóo. He wants the high-speed train to go straight to his city, rather than via Santiago. That would cost €2bn to save just 15 minutes, says Mr Feijóo.</p><p >A nationalist party came second in the election. Its leader, Ana Pontón, wants Galicia “to take our own decisions” on energy, infrastructure and taxes and “the right to decide” on independence. She also wants 50% of teaching to be in Gallego. But most Gallegos seem happy enough with what Mr Feijóo calls “cordial bilingualism” rather than the language war of Catalonia. The nationalist vote seems to have a ceiling of about 25%. “The Gallego has ambitions to lead Spain,” says Miguel Conde-Lobato, an advertising man in A Coruña. “We’re more interested in captaining the ship than capsizing it.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Us Gallegos&quot;</p>
