He has to respect all the religions of his city, he explains. Most Sinhalese, the country’s biggest ethnic group, are Buddhist; Tamils, who predominate in the north, including Jaffna, tend to be Hindu, and there are also small Christian and Muslim minorities. (Mr Arnold himself is Christian.) The ecumenical display, however, prompted griping from his staff: there is little sense of unity in Jaffna these days, even among the Tamil majority, let alone between religions and ethnicities.</p><p >Tamil hopes for an independent homeland were dashed in 2009, when the government defeated the Tamil Tigers, a ruthless separatist insurgency. But many in the north still hanker for autonomy, as promised by amendments to the constitution adopted in 1987 but never fully implemented. Anxieties about majority rule have swelled since the election last year as president of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who as number two in the Ministry of Defence presided over the defeat of the Tigers in a campaign in which many Tamil civilians also died.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >For almost 20 years the main standard-bearer for Tamils in Sri Lankan politics has been the Tamil National Alliance (<small>TNA</small>), a multi-party union led by Mr Arnold’s Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (<small>ITAK</small>). But in elections in August, it slumped from 16 seats in the 225-seat parliament to ten. (Mr Arnold was one of its losing candidates.)</p><p >Mathiaparanan Sumanthiran, the <small>TNA</small>’s spokesman and an <small>MP</small>, blames this “very serious setback” on popular disillusionment after the <small>TNA</small> failed to strike a deal on autonomy with the previous president, Maithripala Sirisena. The alliance had been instrumental in Mr Sirisena’s surprise victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of Gotabaya, in presidential elections in 2015. Yet reconstruction and development of the north after the long civil war was neglected under Mr Sirisena. Equally gallingly, an assembly to draft a new constitution came and went without making a specific proposal. Mr Sirisena began feuding with his prime minister, and most reforms went out of the window. “We put all our eggs in one basket,” laments Mr Sumanthiran.</p><p >The result has been a fracturing of Tamil politics. Canagasabapathy Wigneswaran, a retired Supreme Court judge who had served as the chief minister of Northern Province, of which Jaffna is the capital, left the <small>TNA</small> to form his own party. He won a seat in parliament in August, as did Gajendrakumar Ponnamabalam, another Tamil nationalist who split from <small>ITAK</small>. Others threw their lot in with the Rajapaksa brothers’ party, the Sri Lanka People’s Front (<small>SLPF</small>), on the basis that it could at least provide funds for development. One of them, Angajan Ramanathan, also won a seat. Velupillai Sivagnam, a provincial councillor with <small>ITAK</small> who is in his 70s, cannot remember a time when there were so many different Tamil parties.</p><p >In his maiden speech in parliament, Mr Wigneswaran demanded self-determination for Tamils, who he insisted were “the first indigenous inhabitants of this country”, reigniting a long-running and futile argument over whether Sinhalese or Tamils could claim dibs on the island. But that, says Singaravelu Kumaravel, a Tamil activist, is what many Tamils want: representatives who will rail on their behalf.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Many younger Tamils, however, are not interested in the separatist cause. They have no memory of the 26 years of civil war, says Sivasubramaniam Raguram of Jaffna University. They simply hope for better jobs, which draws them to the <small>SLPF</small>. Without more energised youngsters, however, the future of the “liberation struggle” looks grim, Mr Raguram worries.</p><p >Mr Sumanthiran, however, is more optimistic. He suspects that Mr Rajapaksa’s government will embrace Sinhalese chauvinism so openly, and pursue such discriminatory policies towards Tamils, that it will inadvertently spur Tamil unity. The new parliament has already adopted several constitutional amendments, and Mr Rajapaksa wants a whole new constitution—but the topic of Tamil autonomy has barely come up. Despite their wildly divergent politics, all 13 Tamil <small>MP</small>s signed a letter earlier this month to the president and another of his brothers, Chamal, who is minister for irrigation. It complained about “colonisation” in the form of government efforts to promote Sinhalese migration to Tamil areas. It will not be their last complaint. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The war within&quot;</p>
