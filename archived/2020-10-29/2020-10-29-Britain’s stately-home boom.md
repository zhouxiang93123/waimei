A gallery was lined with pictures of some of the 1,200 mansions that had been demolished in a century—victims of urbanisation, tax and neglect. One thing was clear: never again would the ruling elite build piles like Trentham, which the Shah of Persia told the future king Edward VII should cost its owner, the Duke of Sutherland, his head on the grounds that it was “too grand for a subject”.</p><p >That obituary now requires an epilogue. Stonemasons’ chisels are once again chipping away at the top of long driveways as a new generation of monied Britons commissions its own stately homes. Rebounding demand has prompted a steady supply of architects for whom being a classicist is no longer shameful. “Back in the 1980s if you wanted to build a good-looking classical building…there were about two or three architects in the country who could do that,” says George Saumarez Smith, an architect. “Now there are lots.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Just as the status symbols of old were often built for that generation’s nouveaux riches, so are today’s new-builds. “The peak of a lot of people’s ambition is to have a country house, and that applies not just to British people, but to people coming to Britain,” says Robert Adam, a classical architect who designed Lea House in Surrey (pictured), is currently building two country houses and has three more on order. His clients include self-made financiers, celebrities and Russians.</p><p >Steve Gibson, a welder’s son who made money in logistics and now owns Middlesbrough Football Club, is typical of the new breed. His home in North Yorkshire will be the county’s largest house for 200 years. Christopher Boyle, a lawyer who helps newcomers obtain planning permission, likens them to “the nabobs of the 18th century”, who were keen to show off the riches of empire. They are, he says, “people of extremely fine taste, who have found themselves by good fortune to have lots of cash.”</p><p >The paucity of ancient piles on the market, and the hefty heating bills and musty smells they come with, make building from scratch a good option. The new houses’ architecture usually offers more than a nod to that of their forebears. Brutalism is not a style much favoured. Mr Adam likes to lay out several plans for his clients, but “they almost always choose the Palladian one.” Some people regard such houses as mere pastiches, but they are not carbon copies. For instance, whereas previous generations hid their kitchens at the back of the house or below stairs, today’s lords of the manor like to cook and, according to Mr Saumarez Smith, “want the kitchen in the best part of the house, where they will enjoy good views.”</p><p >And though such grand designs could hardly be described as modest, their owners still claim to be. “Normally the first thing clients say is ‘we are just an ordinary family and we just want a nice house,’” says Mr Saumarez Smith.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Brideshead rebooted&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
